Chrysler Carnage

Introduction

In the team my part was to create the GUI Window, the sound effects for the cars, the environment and the scripting for the sounds.

 Sounds Creation
 
 Due to my background as a musician for twelve years, i started creating music through piano to find the right melody for our main theme of the game. A first recording was at the university in  a room with piano. After being satisfied from the melody i asked a friend to import based on the sound the guitar. I took the final files editing in the beginning with logic and i merged them with audacity where i edited the most part of the soundtrack.
---------

The idea of the team was to have a sound based on the song of Led Zeppelin-Black Dog and Rock and Roll. The outcome was very satisfied so i continued with the environment sound. The idea was to create rock music very fast to make you feel the anxiety and the rush of the game during the game. By the same way i converted part of the piano and the guitar with audacity by changing the pitch of the music organs to have a more electronic outcome. The main sound is attached in the GUI Window and the Environment sound is attached in the main camera of the body of the cars. 
---------

The small sound effects were created in real time by recording the sound and edited in the music program called Audacity. Some of them were made and by me for example the sound bump of the car in the beginning was created by hitting the laptop with my hand and recording that sound.
